# Phoneix Quest

Phoneix Quest was an educational game produced by UBC's EGEMS lab in the late 1990s. It's pretty much disappeared from the modern internet, but the Internet Archive has a copy of [their old website](https://web.archive.org/web/20151025204054/http://www.cs.ubc.ca/labs/egems/phoenixquest.html).

> Phoenix Quest is multi-media, cross-curricular adventure developed by the EGEMS project (Electronic Games for Education in Math and Science) at the University of British Columbia. The EGEMS iterative research and development process involved over 20 teachers and university educators as well as nearly 500 students during a 3 year period.

> The intent of Phoenix Quest is to make mathematics appealing to girls from ages 9 to 14 by incorporating game and activity elements that girls find interesting, important and challenging. Phoenix Quest has an exotic storyline set in mythical islands near Hong Kong; contains intriguing teenage and fantasy characters willing and able to communicate; and encourages cooperative play and group problem solving.
